3.07.24

my landing page looks different now! i added a whole mini "about me" section in the off canvas nav bar with icons that lead to my email, Yakihonne, LinkedIn, and lightning wallet info. I have to spend more time on the about me page and deck it out.

1.22.24 update

I pushed again today. Trying to set up a self hosted nip-05 verifier but am having no success yet.

I realized today that I hadn't added my ssh key to the agent on my machine after uploading it to my github, thus preventing me from accessing this git repo. I finally got it figured out, and committed the rest of the files and code that I am hosting on my asteroid at uberspace.de.

My Uberspace asteroid has enabled me to lean into the concepts I have been learning throughout my journey learning tech.

My asteroid at migs.uber.space currently has a crappy homepage with a professional headshot of myself with a Kingdom Hearts quote generator underneath spitting out quotes from khdatabase.com that I scraped with a homemade web scraper I made in python.

I'll keep updating as I get in a better habit of documentation but that's all for now.
